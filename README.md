I am currently working on prework and half way done with it.

I am currently leaning about JavaScript, Git, GitHub and basics of programming.

I am looking to collaborate on projects with others and build something cool.

I am looking for help with whether to declare a variable outside or inside the function, when to include array[i] when looping over array.
